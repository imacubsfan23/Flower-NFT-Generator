# Flower NFT Generator

- Each procedurally generated shape is completely unique; I call it a flower. 
- To recreate any flower by chance would be about ***1 in 60 million.*** 
- When including its 12 uniquely generated colors into the uniqueness, as well as randomly choosing a color pallet, the chances become about ***1 in 17 quadrillion.***
- By default, each NFT generated is a visualization of a 10-digit base 6 number with 12 “spokes” evenly spread in a circular pattern.

# Usage
